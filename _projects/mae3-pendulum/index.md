title: MAE3 Introduction to Mechanical Design Pendulum Clock
description: I designed, built, and analyzed a precision pendulum timing mechanism for an escapement-based clock system with an irregular monkey-shaped geometry. Developed a MATLAB optimization script to determine optimal placement of 8 adjustable bolt weights to achieve a target 2-second speriod while performing comprehensive mass property and center of mass calculations. Conducted comparative frequency analysis using both point mass and rigid body assumptions, validating theoretical predictions against experimental measurements and achieving 2.8% timing error. Demonstrated proficiency in classical mechanics, computational optimization, CAD-based analysis, and experimental validation techniques.
