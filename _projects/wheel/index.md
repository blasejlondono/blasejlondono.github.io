title: Rover Wheel Redesign
description: I redesigned our rover's wheels, changing them from the heavier air-filled beach rover stylem wheels to a lighter airless tread tire design, supported by custom hubs printed in ASA and layered with bidirectional carbon fiber and resin to boost strength. When designing the new custom hubs, I wrote a simple Python script minimizing curvature to optimize the bezier curve between the tire's rim and the metal hub which attached to the motor. Currently working on improvements to the wheel design, validaitng for strength and shock absorbency (throwing it off of the UCSD Makerspace roof).

- 3D Printing
