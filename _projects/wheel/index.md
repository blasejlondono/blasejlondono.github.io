title: Rover Wheel Redesign
description: I designed and manufactured new carbon fiber wheel hubs using vacuum bag composite manufacturing. I started by creating a stress-minimizing bezier curve profile for the hubs around our wheels in OnShape, then laser-cut a reference profile for each hub and wood lathed molds out of hardwood. After coating the molds in epoxy resin to seal them and sanded them down for a smooth finish, I laid my vacuum bag and breather cloth around the mold, layered the carbon fiber sheets and poured in the resin. After cured, I used a CNC mill to drill out the precision clearance holes to interface with our gearbox profile. Overall, I was able to achieve a 50% weight reduction in the hubs, while maintaining (if not improving!) their strength.
