title: MATLAB Pirouette Recognition Project
description: I built a small custom LSTM neural network in MATLAB to classify pirouette movements from IMU time-series data using MATRLAB's Deep Learning library. Processed multi-dancer dataset and implemented complete training pipeline. Documented methodology in technical paper with faculty guidance, achieved >95% classification accuracy.
