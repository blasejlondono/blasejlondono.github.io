title: Mechanical Design Robot
description: As the leading member of a four-student team, I designed and fabricated a ring-collecting robot with 28" vertical extension. My focus was on our rack-and-pinion mechanism, which I made usinglaser-cut acrylic walls and gears, 3D printed shafts (material budget), a bent sheetmetal base and drill-pressed tap and clearance holes. Developed complete CAD model in Fusion 360, with joints and dependencies, to simulate loading conditions and size in playing field.
