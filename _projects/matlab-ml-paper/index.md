title: MATLAB Pirouette Recognition Project
description: I developed a custom LSTM neural network using the MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox to recognize and classify pirouette movements from a (small) IMU sensor dataset. The model achieved over 85% accuracy in identifying dance movements from the aforementioned time-series inputs. I simulated the recognition system using a custom MATLAB GUI and documented the full methodology and results in an analysis paper (linked below).
