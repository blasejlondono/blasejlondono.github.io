title: Pendulum Clock
description: I designed, built, and analyzed an escapement-wheel pendulum clock with irregular (monkey-shaped) geometry. I wrote a MATLAB optimization script, determining optimal placement of 8 adjustable weights to preserve 2-second period. Validated theoretical period experimentally, achieving <2.8% timing error.
