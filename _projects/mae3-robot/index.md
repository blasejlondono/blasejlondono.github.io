title: UCSD MAE3 Mechanical Design Robot
description: As a member of a four-student team, I designed and fabricated a 4-DOF robotic manipulator mimicking spherical coordinates (θ, φ, ρ) for an autonomous ring retrieval competition. Engineered a dual-stage extension system featuring a primary rack-and-pinion mechanism and secondary motor-driven extension, performing quasi-static force analysis and deriving closed-form equations for extension velocity under loaded conditions. Conducted experimental validation achieving 2.3 in/s extension speed with 63% safety factor relative to theoretical predictions, accounting for friction losses, power transmission inefficiencies, and motor startup dynamics. Demonstrated proficiency in mechanism design, free-body diagram analysis, CAD modeling, experimental testing, and collaborative engineering problem-solving under tight deadlines.
