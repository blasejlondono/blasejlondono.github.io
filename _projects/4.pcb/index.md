title: Power Distribution PCB
description: I made a two-layer 24V 60A power distribution PCB for our competition rover. I designed a custom schematic and layout in Altium Designer, added new fuse blowout indicator lights, employed polygon pours and trace thickness specifications for proper thermal management. Populated and soldered board upon arrival, performed electrical 'stress' test on traces. Board was able to handle around 860W before traces burned out. Reduced PCB footprint by 20%.

- Altium Designer
