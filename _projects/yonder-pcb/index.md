title: Power Distribution PCB
description: I reengineered our 2025 rover's power distribution PCB to handle a new (higher-power) 24V 60A capacity in Altium Designer.During the process, I was also able to reduce the PCB's footprint by 20% through optimized component placement, also added a bunch of nice silkscreen labeling for easier cross-subteam use. Implemented high-current trace routing for thermal management. Also performed general fabrication work including crimping, soldering, and wire sheathing across the Yonder Dynamics 2025 cycle.
